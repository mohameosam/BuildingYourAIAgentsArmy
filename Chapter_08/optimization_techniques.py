# Chapter 8: Optimizing Multi-Agent Systems for Performance and Scalability
# This script demonstrates various optimization techniques for AI models
# such as pruning, quantization, and factorization, used in the auction system.

# Function to simulate model pruning (reduces parameters by removing less important weights)
def prune_model(model_weights, prune_ratio=0.5):
    # Sort weights by magnitude and keep top (1 - prune_ratio) percent
    threshold = np.percentile(np.abs(model_weights), prune_ratio * 100)
    return np.where(np.abs(model_weights) > threshold, model_weights, 0)

# Function to simulate quantization (reduces precision of weights)
def quantize_weights(weights, bits=8):
    # Scale weights to fit within 2^bits levels
    scale = 2 ** bits - 1
    min_val, max_val = np.min(weights), np.max(weights)
    return np.round((weights - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) * scale) / scale

# Function to simulate factorization using SVD (reduces matrix dimensions)
def factorize_matrix(matrix, rank=10):
    # Perform Singular Value Decomposition
    U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(matrix)
    # Reduce to lower rank approximation
    U_reduced = U[:, :rank]
    S_reduced = np.diag(S[:rank])
    Vt_reduced = Vt[:rank, :]
    return U_reduced @ S_reduced @ Vt_reduced

# Example usage

    # Sample weight matrix
